# HAWQS API Examples #

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to use the HAWQS API project builder. You may create a project, add scenarios, add point source or land use update to the scenarios, run the scenarios, and zip the project.

You will need an API key to run the examples. The goal is to keep the examples simple and easy to understand. Therefore, project specific inputs are hard-coded in each class.

Both Python and C\# samples are available. Click each folder and the README in each one for full examples on how to use.

Additional documentation of all the input options is at [dev-api.hawqs.tamu.edu](https://dev-api.hawqs.tamu.edu/).
